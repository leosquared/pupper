# pupper
This [app](https://blooming-shore-50836.herokuapp.com/) will generate a random picture of a pup. 

At the moment, this simple app is an exploration of Heroku's integration with container-based deployments. The dog images are from [Dog CEO](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/). This app is hosted on Heroku's free tier.  

Future ideas for the app include:
- Breed information from Wikipedia
- Using [Youtube's Search API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search), save top videos by breeds using a Python script into a database, then build an endpoint to serve embedded videos relating to the breeds in the app
